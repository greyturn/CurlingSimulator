/* 

Length of the icesheet is 146ft to 150ft long
Width of the curling sheet is 14.2ft to 15.7 ft
A curling rock is approximately 1ft in diameter

Tee line to tee line is 114ft
Top of house to hog line is 21ft - 6ft = 15ft
Adding 12ft for the extra ice to the backlines totals 114 + 12 = 126ft

Using the curling rock as the dimension of one square of the sheet, an array of 14 x 126 ice should work
This way the rings can be acurrately measured ( 12ft, 8ft, 4ft )
